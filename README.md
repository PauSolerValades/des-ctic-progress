# Discrete-Event Simulation of a Continuous-Time Idependent on Bluesky Data

This repository is the progress to build a discrete-event simulation of content diffusion through an Continuous-Time Independent Cascade model with an activity driven behaviour of the users (not everyone is active at the same time) and a Queue based approach (the posts are kept in a user timeline first). It contains previous versions and approaches that either were discarded, used as poc and wanted to keep. The last implementation is [des-ctic](https://github.com/PauSolerValades/des-ctic/)

## static-entites-v1-v2
- v1: chronological order.
- v2: reverse chronological order.

## dynamic-posts-v3
Introduction of paginated data structures on this [repo](https://github.com/PauSolerValades/ds) and topology optimizations

## release-v4

Drops the vtables of the distributions and always logs the trace, does not accept a configuration file. Used to generate the results.
